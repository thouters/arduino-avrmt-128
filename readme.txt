Arduino is an open-source Physical Computing platform based on a simple
i/o board and a development environment that implements the Processing/Wiring
language.

Arduino is an open source project, owned by nobody and supported by many.

For more information, see the website at: http://arduino.berlios.de/

The Team is composed of Massimo Banzi, David Cuartielles, Tom Igoe,
David Mellis and Nicholas Zambetti.

Gianluca Martino works with us on many projects providing help, ideas and
taking care of the production.

Yaniv Steiner and Giorgio Olivero have been supporting the project and are
working at using it with the Instant Soup platform.

millis() now updates every millisecond instead of every second.
Keyspan and FTDI USB drivers included with Mac and Windows distributions.
Bootloader included with Windows distribution (it was already in the Mac dist).
Reversed the analog input pins to correspond to newer boards.  This means
a call, for example, to analogRead(0) must be changed to analogRead(5) in
order to read the same physical pin.
Now flushing the serial port before uploading (should fix some errors).
Added a printNewline() function.
Updated icon of the Windows executable.
Improved accuracy of the delayMicroseconds() function.
New blue color scheme and icons courtesy of Noah Shibley (colors are hardcoded
into the source to ensure consistency with image files).

0002 - 2005.10.05
New build process no longer uses makefiles; now controlled by preferences.txt.
core/ replaced with targets/; can now link against Wiring libraries.
Replaced print() with printString, printInteger, printHex, printByte, etc.
Added menu for selecting serial port speed.
Updated icon.
Bootloader shrunk to less than 1 KB; fuses updated accordingly.
Added serialRead(), serialAvailable(), and delayMicroseconds().

This is the first released of the unified IDE + language library
it's a terrible hack... but it works. at the moment it's in alpha stage
but it can be used to work.
The processing preprocessor is included but not used.
