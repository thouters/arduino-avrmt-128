Add Encoder library.
Comment LiquidCrystal examples.
Write LiquidCrystal documentation.
[done] Update version of avr-gcc, etc. to support ATmega644, ATmega328, etc.
[done] Move #include <WProgram.h> after other #include's?  (prevent it from interfering with standard libraries)
[done] Add LiquidCrystal library.
[done] Add Servo library.
[done] Fix millis() so it overflows on a nice variable-size boundary; see: http://www.arduino.cc/cgi-bin/yabb2/YaBB.pl?num=1205949448
[done] Factor out print statements into a common base class for Serial, LiquidCrystal, etc.

AVR

Bootloader:
 - disable watch dog timer
 - fix eeprom writing: http://www.arduino.cc/cgi-bin/yabb2/YaBB.pl?num=1202157667/15
Support atmega328: http://spiffie.org/know/arduino_328/
Support pin change interrupts.
Switch pwm output on pins 5 and 6 to phase-correct mode, if possible.
Problems including WProgram.h twice?
Add #defines for the analog input pins.
Add parameter to shiftOut() for specifying a number of bits.
Add parameter to Serial.print[ln](x, BIN) for specifying number of bits.
Add support for ATmega1280 (e.g. timers, external interrupts, multiple serial ports).
Add weak attribute to signal handlers: http://www.arduino.cc/cgi-bin/yabb2/YaBB.pl?num=1203798214
Incorporate ladyada's new SoftwareSerial library.
Good way to receive multiple values / complex messages over the serial port (Firmata?)
Floating point support in the map() function.
Way to print floats.
Fix delayMicroseconds(0).
Add sleep function(s).
Add SPI library.
Add OneWire library.
Add pulseOut(), etc. functions from Wiring.
Add Ping example.
Supporting EEMEM directive by changing compiler command line: http://www.arduino.cc/cgi-bin/yabb2/YaBB.pl?num=1202157667
Include Arduino as AVR-ISP sketch in hardware/firmwares.
Move type definitions into WConstants.h.
Change core and libraries to use Arduino types (e.g. byte, boolean).
Fix millis() so it never increments by two.
Consider moving millis() to timer 1, and configuring it so the interrupt is generated once a millisecond.

COMPUTER

Improve preprocessing of sketches:
 - Better determine which header files are included (not commented out).
 - Remember the original locations of function prototypes to highlight the correct line on error.
Multiple sketch windows.
Easier library discovery and installation.
Easier board installation.
Clean up Library and LibraryManager.
Detect dependencies between libraries.
Byte-based serial monitor.
Line termination options in the serial monitor.
Clear character should clear serial monitor.
Incorporate serial-net proxy.
Changing font size should change serial monitor font size.
Deal with shorter screens (e.g. ASUS EEPC).
Investigate method for auto-detecting serial port on Windows.
Guess serial port on the Mac and Linux.
Automatic detection of baud rate for serial monitor (based on the call to Serial.begin() in the current sketch).
Improve, generally, the upload experience (e.g. faster program start after upload, keep-alive messages to bootloader from IDE, shorter bootloader timeout if possible, progress bar)
Allow uploading of .hex files.
Per-board upload.using preference.
Allow for arbitrary compilation command line arguments.
Find in reference should give same message for missing page as for missing page association.
Test find in reference on libraries.

DEVELOPMENT

Update version of the FTDI drivers (Windows).
Remove AVR ISP and giveio drivers (Windows).
Include the executable installer for the FTDI drivers (Windows).
Include newer version of avr-gcc (one that supports the ATmega1280).
Revise fetch.sh to look for version specific pages (names suffixed with, e.g., "-0007")
If possible, install bug tracking and svn on arduino.cc.
Move to ant for build process.

DOCUMENTATION / SITE CONFIGURATION

Multi-language plugin.
Work on opening up website to public editing.
Create form for submitting workshops.
Create form for submitting projects.

DOCUMENTATION / META

Create community section of site.
List of examples we'd like to have.
Style guide for examples, references, and foundations.

DOCUMENTATION / NAVIGATION

Move Hacking section into Learning (and rename?).
Create About section.
Remove Board page.
Move Environment into the Reference section (which should be renamed Programming).

DOCUMENTATION / CONTENTS
